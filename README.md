# parpl: Parse Programming Languages

Parpl is an umbrella for programming language parsers.

Current parsers:
- A [Common Expression Language](https://cel.dev) parser
- A Scheme R7RS parser

## Features

- **Compliant**: strictly follows language specifications
- **Zero-Copy**: Where possible, allows building Arena-based ASTs
- **Safe**: Guards against stack overflow, allows complexity limits (WIP)

This will be followed by a R7RS define-syntax macro expander.

** Work in progress **
